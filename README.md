# EMAIL-SPAM-DETECTION

Project Overview:
I developed an email spam detection system aimed at identifying and filtering out spam emails from legitimate ones. This project leverages machine learning techniques to enhance email security and improve user experience.

# Key Characteristics:

Accuracy: High precision in distinguishing spam from legitimate emails.
Efficiency: Quick processing time ensuring minimal delay in email delivery.
Scalability: Can handle a large volume of emails seamlessly.

# Tools and Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy
Machine Learning Models: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Data Handling: Email datasets for training and testing
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

# What I Did:

Collected and preprocessed email data, ensuring it was clean and suitable for training.
Implemented machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or not spam.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Optimized models for better performance and reduced false positives/negatives.
Visualized the results to interpret model effectiveness and improve decision-making.
